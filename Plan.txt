- The first time, you had memory leaks after the program ended
- Ultimately, it just dies in heuristic method
- Re-plan objects properly 
- Run valgrind regularly!!!!! - learn how to read it first
- Do DFS
- Do BFS
- Ensure there are no memory leaks - seg fault due to many nodes is OK
- Try BestFS seperately
