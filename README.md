# 8puzzle
Attempt at making a 8puzzle work for DFS, BFS and heuristic without any crashes and memory leaks - ACCOMPLISHED!!

To run program:

- Run program - type 'make'
- execute program - type './assign2'
- Or: type 'make run'. 
- Input is 9 integers prompted one by one and a 0 is used to indicate a blank. 
Eg: 1,3,4,8,6,2,7,5,0  - easy
Eg: 2,8,1,4,3,0,7,6,5 - med

- Program will return the number of nodes/states generated as well as the path from initial state to goal state
